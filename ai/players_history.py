todo: memorize the history of the decisions for each player to analyse their behavior
What should we write down?
- Player's Bet size
- Known cards
- Other players' bets
- Player's hand if the round ended with a showdown

What should we analyse?
- How often does the player fold and what the stakes are
- When do they bet: the possible win ratio at the each point and the stakes size
